\section{Literature Review}
% thinking Zyria needs to go here, also the FFT/parallel scan paper I sent, maybe just some parallel alg papers that map well to hardware?

\section{Alterations to the Proposal}
Rather than leveraging the CIRCT framework, we now plan on having our compiler emit Calyx IR. This IR will then be lowered into Verilog, which we can show
as a timing simulation and potentially deploy to an FPGA. We decided to use Calyx as it has a more mature build system, and is not as experimental/development
focused as CIRCT is right now.
\section{Concrete Steps}
So far, we have built sample circuits with Calyx IR, including a 4 bit adder circuit. We have simulated this circuit using Icarus, and are able to view the timing
simulations in GTKWave. % fill in with parsing/lang details too
