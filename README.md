*Why the name "Zinnia"?* We use Calyx, which is also the collective name for the petals of a flower. [Zinnias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinnia) are one species of flowers. It also sounds kind of like [Zyria](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ASPLOS-camera.pdf), which is a language we took inspiration from.
